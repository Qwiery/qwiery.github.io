The graph data model is a powerful way to represent and query data. It is a natural way to model many types of data and is particularly well-suited for data that is interconnected.</p><h2 id="where-does-the-name-qwiery-come-from" tabindex="-1">Where does the name &#39;Qwiery&#39; come from? <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-does-the-name-qwiery-come-from" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where does the name &#39;Qwiery&#39; come from?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It refers to the word &#39;query&#39; and is a play on the word &#39;query&#39; and &#39;wiry&#39; (as in &#39;lean and strong&#39;).</p><h2 id="why-vue-nuxt-and-not-react-next-or-angular" tabindex="-1">Why Vue/Nuxt and not React/Next or Angular? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-vue-nuxt-and-not-react-next-or-angular" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why Vue/Nuxt and not React/Next or Angular?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One has to make a choice when embarking on a project. It&#39;s a personal preference and does not imply any qualitative distinction or rejection of other frameworks. There will be React/Next forks in the future and many packages (the utils, the graph library, all of the Qwiery data access layer) are, in fact, independent of the UI frameworks. These are standard npm packages and can be used with any client (or backend) JavaScript/TypeScript context.</p><h2 id="why-yfiles-and-ogma-why-not-d3-or-vis-js" tabindex="-1">Why yFiles and Ogma? Why not D3 or Vis.js? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-yfiles-and-ogma-why-not-d3-or-vis-js" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why yFiles and Ogma? Why not D3 or Vis.js?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Actually, Qwiery is not bound to any graph visualization library. The graph visualization is a separate package and can be swapped out. The reason for choosing yFiles and Ogma is that they are very powerful and have a great feature set. They are also well-documented and have a great support community.</p><p>We do have integrations with Cytoscape, d3 and Vis.js, but if you want an enterprise solution, yFiles and Ogma are the way to go.</p><p>We have partnered with both yFiles and Linkurious in the past decade and have delivered tons of projects with these libraries. We are a reseller of yFiles and Linkurious and have a great relationship with these teams.</p><h2 id="why-typescript" tabindex="-1">Why TypeScript? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-typescript" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why TypeScript?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and adds static typing to the language. It is a very powerful tool to write better code and to catch bugs early. It is also a great way to document the code and to make it more readable. TypeScript is a first-class citizen in the JavaScript world and is supported by all major frameworks and tools.</p><h2 id="can-qwiery-be-used-in-a-browser" tabindex="-1">Can Qwiery be used in a browser? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-qwiery-be-used-in-a-browser" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can Qwiery be used in a browser?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Yes, most of the Qwiery packages can. The data abstraction layer (aka DAL) is, however, meant to be used with NodeJs because of its dependency on the file system and/or connectivity to data stores.</p><h2 id="can-qwiery-be-used-in-a-commercial-project" tabindex="-1">Can Qwiery be used in a commercial project? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-qwiery-be-used-in-a-commercial-project" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can Qwiery be used in a commercial project?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>All of the Qwiery packages are MIT licensed and can be used in any project, commercial or not.

With Qwiery Dashboards we want to be open to other graph databases (MemGraph KuzuDB, ArcadeDB and others) and to other (not necessarily graph) data sources. The Qwiery Dashboards also boast high-end graph visualization libraries (yFiles and Ogma). Finally, React (on which NeoDash is based) is a highly popular but horrible framework. Qwiery is based on Vue/Nuxt and this gives an additional alternative to the community.</p><h2 id="what-about-tableau-or-apache-superset-or" tabindex="-1">What about Tableau or Apache Superset or ...? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-about-tableau-or-apache-superset-or" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What about Tableau or Apache Superset or ...?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Qwiery Dashboards are not meant to be a replacement for these products. There is, however, a need for graph-based reporting and visualization. All of the commercial BI tools are focused on relational data (for good reasons) and the Qwiery Dashboards are a solution if you with to prototype graph visualizations. We made sure that it&#39;s easy to extend, so you can use it as a stepping stone or as a mockup for a fully fledged BI solution.</p><h2 id="contact-info" tabindex="-1">Contact info? <a class="header-anchor" href="#contact-info" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Contact info?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You can find all the info you need <a href="https://graphsandnetworks.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-relation-between-qwiery-and-orbifold" tabindex="-1">What is the relation between Qwiery and Orbifold? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-relation-between-qwiery-and-orbifold" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the relation between Qwiery and Orbifold?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Qwiery is a product of Orbifold Consulting.
