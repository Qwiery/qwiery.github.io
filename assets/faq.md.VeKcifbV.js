It&#39;s a personal preference and does not imply any qualitative distinction or rejection of other frameworks. There will be React/Next forks in the future and many packages (the utils, the graph library, all of the Qwiery data access layer) are, in fact, independent of the UI frameworks. These are standard npm packages and can be used with any client (or backend) JavaScript/TypeScript context.</p><h2 id="why-typescript" tabindex="-1">Why TypeScript? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-typescript" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why TypeScript?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and adds static typing to the language. It is a very powerful tool to write better code and to catch bugs early. It is also a great way to document the code and to make it more readable. TypeScript is a first-class citizen in the JavaScript world and is supported by all major frameworks and tools.</p><h2 id="can-qwiery-be-used-in-a-browser" tabindex="-1">Can Qwiery be used in a browser? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-qwiery-be-used-in-a-browser" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can Qwiery be used in a browser?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Yes, most of the Qwiery packages can. The data abstraction layer (aka DAL) is, however, meant to be used with NodeJs because of its dependency on the file system and/or connectivity to data stores.</p><h2 id="can-qwiery-be-used-in-a-commercial-project" tabindex="-1">Can Qwiery be used in a commercial project? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-qwiery-be-used-in-a-commercial-project" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can Qwiery be used in a commercial project?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>All of the Qwiery packages are MIT licensed and can be used in any project, commercial or not.
