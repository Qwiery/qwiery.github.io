## Application Panel

The application panel aka settings is where you can find the following functionalities:

- **reset** the set of dashboards to the default/predefined set
- **download** the current set of dashboards as a `json` file
- **clear** all the dashboards.

Note that dashboards are saved as JSON in the local storage of the browser. We also have an enterprise version that allows you to save the dashboards in a database (MongoDB and alike).

The panel also lists the dashboard connections. Every widget can use a different connection and this is where you can add, edit, and remove connections.
Out of the box we supply the list of freely available Neo4j Labs databases. These are read-only and are meant to be used for testing and learning purposes.

## Toolbar

The toolbar is where you can find the following functionalities:

- **properties** change the properties of the dashboard
- **add** a new dashboard
- **delete** the current dashboard

The toolbar is also where you can find the set of widgets that you can add to the dashboard.

## Dashboards Panel

The dashboards panel is where you can find the list of dashboards. You can switch between dashboards by clicking on the dashboard name.
