Qwiery Dashboards are a way to visualize data in a more graphical way. They are a collection of widgets that can be arranged in a grid. The widgets can be of various types, such as charts, tables, and maps. Dashboards are a great way to monitor data and to get a quick overview of what is happening in your organization. They can be used to monitor sales, customer satisfaction, website traffic, and much more. Dashboards can be shared with others and can be embedded in other applications. They can also be exported to PDF or image files.

Unlike other dashboard solutions, Qwiery Dashboards are focused on graph-like data and are designed to be used with a graph database. This means that you can create dashboards that show relationships between entities, such as customers, products, and orders. This makes it easy to see how different parts of your organization are connected and how they are performing.
