# Dashboards Configuration Options
  
All Qwiery data is stored locally in your browser. This means that you can create and modify dashboards without any server interaction.

- **reset** the set of dashboards to the default/predefined set
- **download** the current set of dashboards as a `json` file
- **clear** all the dashboards.

The **local browser storage is limited** and this means that if your dashboards become too large, you will get a warning. We have an enterprise version that allows you to save the dashboards in a database (MongoDB and alike) and go beyond this limitation. [Ping us if you are interested.](https://graphsandnetworks.com/contact)
