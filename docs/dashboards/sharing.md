Dashboards can be shared via a simple hyperlink, you can distribute and bookmark this link to access the dashboard.

Upon clicking the link, the dashboard will be added to the dashboard collection of the user. If a dashboard with the same id already exists, a confirmation dialog will ask whether to overwrite the existing one.

_We will add in the future more sharing options, like dashboard constraints (can save, can edit, can move widgets, etc.)_
