# Intro

Qwiery is a powerful framework for **managing graph-like data in the browser and server-side**. It supports a wide range of use cases by means of plugins and storage adapters (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, LocalStorage...). 

With Qwiery, you can:

- Model and **manage complex relationships** between data.
- Enforce consistency using **an optional schema (aka ontology)** via plugins.
- Change how your graph data is **stored by changing adapters**.
- Chain plugins and adapters to **assemble your business logic**.

 Qwiery is **open source**, which means you have the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software as you see fit. You can also contribute to the development of the database by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or code changes.

 Plugins and adapters are **easy to develop and to hook up**. The code is plain JavaScript and can be used in the browser or with NodeJs.
