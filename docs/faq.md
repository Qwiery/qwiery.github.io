# FAQ

## Why Vue/Nuxt and not React/Next or Angular?

One has to make a choice when embarking on a project. It's a personal preference and does not imply any qualitative distinction or rejection of other frameworks. There will be React/Next forks in the future and many packages (the utils, the graph library, all of the Qwiery data access layer) are, in fact, independent of the UI frameworks. These are standard npm packages and can be used with any client (or backend) JavaScript/TypeScript context.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and adds static typing to the language. It is a very powerful tool to write better code and to catch bugs early. It is also a great way to document the code and to make it more readable. TypeScript is a first-class citizen in the JavaScript world and is supported by all major frameworks and tools. 

## Can Qwiery be used in a browser?

Yes, most of the Qwiery packages can. The data abstraction layer (aka DAL) is, however, meant to be used with NodeJs because of its dependency on the file system and/or connectivity to data stores. 

## Can Qwiery be used in a commercial project?

All of the Qwiery packages are MIT licensed and can be used in any project, commercial or not. Users of software using an MIT License are permitted to use, copy, modify, merge publish, distribute, sublicense and sell copies of the software. 
You do need to include the license in your project.

Do not abuse or misuse the Qwiery brand and logo. Do not use the Qwiery brand or logo in a way that suggests any type of association or partnership with Qwiery. Do not use the Qwiery brand or logo in a way that is harmful, deceptive, obscene or otherwise objectionable to the average person. Do not alter the Qwiery brand or logo in any way. Do not register a domain name containing the Qwiery brand or logo or any confusingly similar words or marks.

Same goes for the name 'Orbifold' or 'Orbifold Consulting'.

## Can I contribute?

Yes, please do. The project is open source and contributions are welcome. 

## Can I use Qwiery in my own project?

Yes, you can. The Qwiery packages are all MIT licensed and can be used in any project, commercial or not.

## What is the roadmap?

The roadmap is a living document and can be found [here](vision.md).
