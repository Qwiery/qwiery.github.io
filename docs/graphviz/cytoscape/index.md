# Cytoscape


The open source [Cytoscape.js library](https://js.cytoscape.org/) is a powerful graph visualization library that allows you to create interactive and customizable network graphs.

**Pro:**

- it provides a wide range of features and options for creating and manipulating graphs, including layout algorithms, styling options, and event handling
- you can easily visualize complex data structures and relationships in a visually appealing and intuitive way
- large community and lots of plugins
- stable and mature
- open source (MIT license).

**Con:**

- limited set of layout algorithms
- not geared toward some type of diagrams (UML, database schema, swimlanes, Sankey...)
- does not support WebGL
- limited styling options
- not enterprise support.


:::info Qwiery
Qwiery has a client branch using Cytoscape for graph visualization. It fully supports all sorts of graph visualization scenario's but if you wish to have an enterprise-level app you should consider [Ogma](/graphviz/ogma/) or [yFiles](/graphviz/yfiles/)
